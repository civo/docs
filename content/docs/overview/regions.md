Civo resources can be deployed in a number of regions around the world.

Resources such as Kubernetes clusters and virtual machine instances are region-specific. This means that running clusters are displayed only on the listings in the region where they are deployed.

## Selecting a region on the web dashboard

You can select a region from the region drop-down menu at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar in your account on any page of the Civo dashboard:

## Selecting a region on the command line

With [Civo CLI](../overview/tools-overview), you can see the list of available regions by running:

```bash
civo region list
```

You can then select a region from the list by running:

```bash
civo region use <REGION_CODE>
```

This will execute any further commands in the region of your choice.

:::tip
You can also pass a `--region <CODE>` parameter to any CLI command to execute it in the region specified by the code, without changing or setting your current region.
