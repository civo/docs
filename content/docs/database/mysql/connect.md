- To list your databases, run:

```bash
civo database list
```

## Connect to your Civo Database

The `mysql` client command is a popular choice for connecting to MySQL databases. 

Execute the command without the password and enter it when prompted to ensure security:

```bash
mysql -h [MySQL host IP/FQDN] -u [username] -p
```

## Connection Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues, verify that your credentials are correct and that the Civo firewall allows connections from your source IP address, if you need further assistance contact support.

## Post-Connection Validation

 Once connected, run a test query to validate the connection:

```bash
SHOW DATABASES;
```
Ensure that the expected databases are listed and accessible.
