## Introduction to Compute Instances

Civo is a cloud computing platform. As part of the compute services offered, users can launch virtual machines (VMs) in all available regions. On Civo, these virtual machines are called Instances.

Instances can have a variety of Linux operating systems, and come in a range of sizes and capacities, which determine the price charged to you.

Each section of this documentation assumes you have an [active Civo account](../account/signing-up.md), and the appropriate [tools](../overview/tools-overview.md) installed on your machine. To manage your instances after launch, you will need to have an SSH client installed for your operating system.
