## Kubeflow on Civo

The Civo machine learning service leverages Kubeflow and other Civo services to provide an integrated, managed service to manage machine learning experiments.

## ⚠️ Deprecated Product Alert

**This managed product is deprecated and will be removed in the future.** Please consider alternatives.

### What is Kubeflow?

[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) is an open source machine learning platform developed by Google to accelerate the development cycle of machine learning experiments to run at scale on Kubernetes.

Kubeflow provides a way for multiple end users with diverse expertise to collaborate together. A Kubernetes infrastructure engineer, machine learning engineer and a data analyst will all find themselves at home within the ecosystem.

If you’ve built Machine Learning on open source technologies before, you'll find Kubeflow to be a relatively familiar experience, but if you’re getting started with Kubeflow on your own, we’ve included some of the first steps to help you get started on your journey.
