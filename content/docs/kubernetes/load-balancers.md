  <title>Using Load Balancers with Civo Clusters | Civo Documentation</title>
</head>

## Overview

On Civo, Kubernetes cluster `LoadBalancer` objects are external to your cluster, but created and managed as part of your cluster's service definitions. In other words, you create them like other `Service` objects in Kubernetes as part of your cluster definition, but their state is handled by the Cloud Controller Manager that speaks to the Civo API. This allows you to have a service that routes traffic into your cluster externally, balancing the traffic between the nodes.

Civo Kubernetes load balancers are a managed implementation of the Kubernetes [External Load Balancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/). This means if you create a `Service` object of type `LoadBalancer` the Civo API will detect this, and on assigning the load balancer a public IP address will start to account for its usage as part of your [billing](../account/billing.md) and [quota](../account/quota.md).

Kubernetes load balancers, like all Civo resources, are billed hourly according to the [current pricing](https://www.civo.com/pricing). Additional costs apply for each subsequent 10,000 concurrent requests you configure the load balancer to handle.

## Creating a Kubernetes load balancer

Being strictly a Kubernetes object, Kubernetes load balancers must be defined in a running cluster. There is no way to start a Kubernetes load balancer for a cluster from the dashboard, as they are application-specific.

Definining a load balancer can be done either using `kubectl` to define a `Service` in your cluster, or by launching a Marketplace application that defines one for you. The documentation below shows the creation of a load balancer using `kubectl` as Marketplace applications configure them automatically.

To define a Civo Kubernetes load balancer object, at a minimum you need to define the Service and its type as `LoadBalancer`, such as:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: civo-lb-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: example-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 5000
    targetPort: 8443
    name: example-app
```

This should be applied to your cluster with `kubectl apply -f loadbalancer.yaml`.

As mentioned above, creating a load balancer relies on the Civo Cloud Controller Manager sending the appropriate request to the Civo API to handle the creation and configuration of the Load Balancer according to your specification. This system means that if you create any `Service` with type `LoadBalancer`, it will be picked up by the Civo API and as part of the [Load balancers listing](https://dashboard.civo.com/loadbalancers) as well as on the cluster's dashboard page in your account:

![Kubernetes load balancer as displayed on the Civo dashboard](images/loadbalancers-list.png)

There are several available configuration options for Kubernetes load balancers, detailed below.

## Kubernetes load balancer configuration options

The Civo load balancer specification allows optional configuration elements. These are detailed below. Configuration options for your Load Balancer are to be specified in the the appropriate block of your `LoadBalancer` service definition.

### Algorithm

The load balancing algorithm, if provided, is one of `round_robin` or `least_connections`. The default, if not provided, is `round_robin`. This is specified in a `metadata/annotation` prefixed by `kubernetes.civo.com/` as follows:

```yaml
  annotations:
    kubernetes.civo.com/loadbalancer-algorithm: least_connections
```

or

```yaml
  annotations:
    kubernetes.civo.com/loadbalancer-algorithm: round_robin
```

### External traffic policy

The external traffic policy, if provided, is one of `Cluster` or `Local`. `Cluster`, the default, means routing of external traffic to cluster-wide endpoints and ensures evenness of the request load across . `Local` is only for HTTP traffic, and preserves the client source IP using a `X-Forwarded-For` header added to the request, with the side effect of less efficient load balancing.

The specification for the external traffic policy is made through a `spec` in your Service definition:

```yaml
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
```

or

```yaml
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
```

### Firewall ID

The firewall configuration for your Load Balancer is specified in an annotation `kubernetes.civo.com/firewall-id` that takes the ID of your chosen firewall as input, such as:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.civo.com/firewall-id: 3eb6534a-4f81-4bb9-9d91-a382391f18ad
```

The firewall must be specified using its ID, rather than displayed name.

If a firewall is not specified in an annotation, the Load Balancer will use the default firewall and not close any ports.

:::note
The firewall ID must be found in the same region as your cluster, otherwise the load balancer will present an error of the specified resource not being found.
:::

### Proxy Protocol

Civo Load Balancers support the HAProxy [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/use-the-proxy-protocol-to-preserve-a-clients-ip-address). Use of the Proxy Protocol allows for the preservation of client IP information to supporting services such as NginX. Not enabled by default.

Supported values are `send-proxy` and `send-proxy-v2`.

Proxy Protocol can be enabled with:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
   kubernetes.civo.com/loadbalancer-enable-proxy-protocol: send-proxy
```

### Reserved IP address

If you have [reserved a public IP address](https://dashboard.civo.com/reserved-ips) you can assign it to a Kubernetes load balancer to ensure public routing into a service remains constant. The annotation for your service definition is as follows:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.civo.com/ipv4-address: "value of reserved IP address"
```

:::tip
You can update any of the configuration options detailed above in your service definition and re-apply it to your cluster without having to remove and re-create the load balancer.
:::

### Maximum concurrent requests

By default, Kubernetes load balancers are configured to handle 10,000 concurrent requests. You can increase this limit by setting the annotation `kubernetes.civo.com/max-concurrent-requests` to a value above `10000`. The annotation for your service definition is as follows:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
      kubernetes.civo.com/max-concurrent-requests: "20000"
```

:::warning
If you update the maxmimum concurrent requests annotation, the load balancer will have a brief period of downtime as it rebuilds.
:::

An additional load balancer charge will be levied for each 10,000 requests above the default limit.

## Instance Pools
`LoadBalancer` objects can target a specific pool of Civo Instances to obtain more granularity over traffic distribution, making it easier to balance loads across instances.

An example of Civo LoadBalancer with InstancePools is:
```yaml
apiVersion: stack.civo.com/v1alpha1
kind: CivoLoadBalancer
metadata:
  name: example-instance-lb
spec:
  algorithm: round_robin
  backendType: envoy
  instancePools:
    - protocol: http
      # Only one method should be used at a time between tags and names
      tags: ["api"]
      sourcePort: 80
      targetPort: 8081
      healthCheck:
        port: 8081
        path: /healthz
    - protocol: http
      # Only one method should be used at a time between tags and names
      names: ["db-1", "db-2"] 
      sourcePort: 9443
      targetPort: 9443
      healthCheck:
        port: 9443
        path: /healthz
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
```
The InstancePool configuration supports the use of both tags and instance names to identify instances in the instance pool. However, **only one method (tags or names) should be used at a time**.

For example, targeting by tags:

```yaml
tags: ["frontend"]
```
Or, targeting by instance names:

```yaml
names: ["app-1", "app-2"]
```

### Health Checks
Health checks for the instances in each pool can be specified to ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy instances. The configuration of health checks for each InstancePool allows the load balancer to continuously monitor the health of each instance.


## Viewing details of a Kubernetes load balancer
<Tabs groupId="list-loadbalancer">
<TabItem value="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

You can view the current configuration of any load balancers both on the [load balancers listing page](https://dashboard.civo.com/loadbalancers), as well as on the page of the cluster where the load balancer is configured:

![Kubernetes load balancer as displayed on the Civo dashboard](images/loadbalancers-list.png)

You can also view more specific details of a particular load balancer by dropping down the "Actions" menu and selecting "View".


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Civo CLI">

The CLI command for viewing load balancers is `civo loadbalancer list`.

The command will show details of load balancers in the region, their algorithm, status, and more:

```console
$ civo loadbalancer list
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+--------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name                               | Algorithm   | Public IP   | State     | Backends                 |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+--------------------------+
| 003c874e-c71c-4119-9d1c-edb39f68cb0c | kubernetes-default-civo-lb-service | round_robin | 74.220.23.6 | available | 192.168.1.4, 192.168.1.3 |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+--------------------------+
```

You can also view more specific details of a particular load balancer by running `civo loadbalancer show <load balancer name>`:

```console
$ civo loadbalancer show kubernetes-default-civo-lb-service
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name                               | Algorithm   | Public IP     | State     | DNS Entry                                        | Backends                 |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+

## Deleting a Kubernetes load balancer

The Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) running in your cluster will handle the deletion of a Civo load balancer once the accompanying Service is deleted from your cluster. You can delete the load balancer, and stop billing for the load balancer, by either deleting the service definition using the manifest file as in the example below, or by deleting the service from the cluster itself:

```console
$ kubectl delete -f loadbalancer.yaml
service "civo-lb-service" deleted
```

The charge for the Load Balancer and additional public IP will end when the Service object is deleted.
