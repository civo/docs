## Introduction

Managed Kubernetes is one of the core services of Civo services, and is certified conformant by Cloud Native Computing Foundating (CNCF). Civo Kubernetes is fully compatible with the wider cloud-native ecosystem and enables you to create Civo Kubernetes clusters in all Civo regions.

This documentation covers management of Kubernetes clusters on Civo using the web interface, the Civo CLI, and using Terraform as an example of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.

## Kubernetes Prerequisites

The Kubernetes documentation included here assumes you have the following items configured.

- An [active Civo account](../account/signing-up.md)
- Some [related tools for installation](../overview/tools-overview.md)
- The [kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) for your specific operating system to manage clusters after launch
