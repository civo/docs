# Kubernetes Introduction

Managed Kubernetes is one of the core Civo services. You can create Kubernetes clusters in all Civo regions. Civo Kubernetes is fully compatible with the wider cloud-native ecosystem, and is certified CNCF conformant.

This documentation section covers management of Kubernetes clusters on Civo using the web interface, the Civo CLI, and Terraform as an example of Infrastructure as Code tools.

Each section of this documentation assumes you have an [active Civo account](../account/signing-up.md), and the appropriate [tools](../overview/tools-overview.md) installed on your machine. To manage your cluster after launch, you will need to [have kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) for your operating system.
