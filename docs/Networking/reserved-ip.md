# Reserved IP addresses

While resources that are accessible from the public internet, such as [instances](../compute/instances-introduction) and Kubernetes cluster load balancers, get assigned public IP addresses when they are created, there are times you may wish to ensure that the IP address gets reserved to you. This allows you to change these publicly routable resources without changing their IP addresses. Reserving a [static IP address](https://dashboard.civo.com/reserved-ips) allows you to reassign the address from one instance to another to build resiliency.

If you create a new instance or load balancer, you will be able to attach a reserved IP address in your account. If you select an address that is already assigned to a resource, it will be moved to the new one immediately.

If you release a reserved IP address assignment from an instance or load balancer, the address remains in your account to be assigned to other resources unless you delete it.

You can claim reserved IPs subject to your [quota allowance](../account/quota). Reserved IPs are region-specifc, which means each one you reserve can only be used for resources within that Civo region.

## Reserving a new IP address from the Dashboard

The [Reserved IP section](https://dashboard.civo.com/reserved-ips) of your account allows you to claim a new IP address, or view addresses you have reserved.

![Reserved IPs menu](images/reserved-ips-menu.png)

Begin by clicking "Create a reserved IP".

The pop-up will ask you to give a name for your reserved IP. This is a label to help you to remember the purpose of the reservation.

When you confirm this name, you will see the newly-reserved IP details on the dashboard. This will also show the address is not assigned to a resource.

The *Actions* menu for each address you reserve will allow you to either *Assign* the address to a running Civo instance, or *Delete* the address to stop it counting toward your quota and billing.

## Reserving an IP address using Civo CLI

The command to reserve a new IP address is `civo ip reserve`. It takes an optional argument `-n <label>` to assign a name to the newly-reserved address:

```bash
$ civo ip reserve -n docs-demo
Reserved IP called docs-demo with ID 4828b05a-3ee2-4e3f-bb5d-108345ac6ba5
```

If you do not provide the `-n <label>` argument, the Civo API will assign the address value as the name for the reserved IP:

```bash
```
