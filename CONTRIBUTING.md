# Contributing to Civo Documentation

Thank you for wanting to contribute to Civo's open-source documentation! Your time and work is appreciated, and can help other Civo users.

This document is an overview of the process of contributing, and some best practices to follow.

## How to contribute documentation

To contribute a correction, clarification, or fix, please don't hesitate to open a pull request in this repository.

If you wish to add a new documentation topic, the process is the same (open a PR with details of what you are proposing to add) but consider whether it is a documentation topic or may be best used as a [Tutorial](https://www.civo.com/learn) instead. If in doubt, open an Issue to discuss!

Civo documentation uses Docusaurus. The documentation files are in Markdown with added extensions to allow for tabs and other elements not present in regular Markdown. For their correct usage, please see existing documentation pieces in this repository, or refer to the [Docusaurus Markdown site](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features). 

## Contribution best practices

- If you are proposing a larger change or an entirely new piece of documentation, consider opening an Issue in this repository first to allow for discussion. This can allow the maintainers and Civo community to discuss the best way forward.

- Small changes (such as fixing typos) can be made in the GitHub web editor, which automates making a fork of this repository and walks you through raising a Pull Request.

- Larger changes may require you to clone the repository locally and start the development server (see the [README](README.md)) to check that everything renders as you expect it to.

- Make sure your Pull Requests are self-contained and focused. If you have made multiple individual commits before raising your Pull Request, consider squashing your commits into a single change commit.
