## Introduction to Compute Instances

Civo is a cloud computing platform. As part of the compute services offered, users can launch virtual machines in all available regions. On Civo, these virtual machines are called Instances.

Instances can have a variety of Linux operating systems, and come in a range of sizes and capacities, which determine the price charged to you.

Each section of this documentation assumes you have an [active Civo account](../account/signing-up.md), and the appropriate [tools](../overview/tools-overview.md) installed on your machine. To manage your instances after launch, you will need to have an SSH client installed for your operating system.
